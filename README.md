# Ticket Booking System  

This project is a Ticket Booking System designed using **Clean Architecture** and **CQRS** principles. The goal is to create a scalable and maintainable system that separates concerns and allows for easy testing and extension.

## Introduction  

The Ticket Booking System allows users to reserve and book tickets for various events. It uses a robust structure to handle tickets efficiently while ensuring scalability and maintainability.  

## Architecture  

### Clean Architecture  

Clean Architecture, conceived by Robert C. Martin, is an architectural pattern that emphasizes separation of concerns across the application. It allows for independent development, testing, and deployment of different components.  

The main principles of Clean Architecture include:  

- **Independence of Frameworks:** You can use any framework without being tied to it.  
- **Testability:** The business logic is independent and can be tested without external dependencies.  
- **UI Independence:** The user interface can be modified without changing the application core.  

In this system, we have divided the application into layers:  
- **Domain Layer:** Contains the core business logic and entities.  
- **Application Layer:** Holds the application logic, including commands and queries.  
- **Infrastructure Layer:** Manages data access and communication with external services.  
- **Presentation Layer:** Exposes the application through an API.  

### CQRS  

CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is a pattern that separates read and write operations. The benefits include:  

- **Scalability:** You can optimize read and write models separately.  
- **Flexibility:** Allows for different data models for reading and writing.  
- **Enhanced Security:** Different permissions can be applied for commands and queries.  

In this project:  
- **Commands** handle writing operations, such as reserving and confirming tickets.  
- **Queries** handle reading operations, such as fetching ticket information.  

## Features  

- Reserve tickets with a valid time window.  
- Confirm payments for reserved tickets.  
- Automatic expiration of reservations.  
- Support for event management.  
- Clear separation of commands and queries.  

## Technologies Used  

- ASP.NET Core  
- Entity Framework Core  
- MassTransit for messaging  
- RabbitMQ for message queuing  
- AutoMapper for object mapping  
- MediatR for CQRS implementation
